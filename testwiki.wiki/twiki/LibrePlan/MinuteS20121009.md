 Minutes
--------

-   First we reviewed the previous [RoadMap](LibrePlan_RoadMap) for version 1.3 and the tasks done in that release:
    -   All top priority tasks but *Improve help and documentation*
    -   Some medium priority tasks: *Vertical line to show with the start of the project*, *KPIs per project* and *Subcontracting module*
    -   Apart from other extra features not initially defined in the original roadmap

&nbsp;

-   We discussed about the possible tasks for the next release 1.4, and the final list is composed by the following ones:
    -   **Top priority**
        -   Add a filter by project status in the projects screens
        -   Add a quicksearch to find projects easier in the projects screens
        -   Right mouse menu register in the left menu of the project planning perspective
        -   Protect the upper menu from abandoning the planning of a project without saving
        -   Improve documentation
    -   **Medium prioriy**
        -   Import projects from Microsfot Project and Planner ![wip](/twiki/pub/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/wip.gif)
        -   Review possible performance issues in order to look for some improvements
        -   Add a new project status called `pre-sales`
        -   JIRA integration ![wip](/twiki/pub/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/wip.gif)
        -   Show the load of the resources to be assigned in allocation pop-up ![wip](/twiki/pub/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/wip.gif)

&nbsp;

-   Some other tasks were left out of the roadmap for 1.4 but could be interesting to be included in the future:
    -   Save KPIs in database in order to wrap up the project status
    -   Add CSV import/export for projects
    -   Add a **pipeline** page to show projects grouped by status
    -   Make WBS screen more user-friendly with more keyboard shortcuts and some other thins like columns for dependencies and so on
    -   Print Gantt chart in PDF format
    -   Include the **groups** feature:
        -   A group or department will be composed by a list of resources
        -   Add filters to show only projects/resources belonging to a group

&nbsp;

-   Finally we defined the estimated date for LibrePlan 1.4 release as **week 1**
