-   Lucía García
    -   She has been working in the mobile app to report work hours.
    -   Currently the application reads the work reports from the web services and show them in a list. It's also possible to create a new work report with its work report lines
    -   She is working in generating the XML file to be sent to the web service

-   LibrePlan 1.3
    -   We're in the week 24 that it was supposed to be the release week ([see announcement](http://www.libreplan.com/news/detail/article/some-updates-about-libreplan-13/)) but we're delayed again ![frown](/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/frown.gif "frown")
    -   Pending things:
        -   Permissions enhancements: Plan is to finish it this week or at the beginning of the next one
        -   Help improvement: We're really delayed with this task, we'll try to have something for the release, but it won't block the release and will be included in a later minor version (like 1.3.1 or so)
    -   There're a lot of new features in LibrePlan 1.3 so we need to invest some time in testing and bugfixing
    -   We should notify the translators with some margin as there're a lot of new features, but we want to do a day of strings review to improve some of them in the original language
    -   So the new date for LibrePlan 1.3 release is **week 28**. We should announce this new delay again this week
