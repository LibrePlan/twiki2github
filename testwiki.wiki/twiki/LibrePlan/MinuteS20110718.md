        -   Patch review (helped Nacho and Cristina with their tasks with some small patches)
        -   LDAP branch finally merged to master
        -   Reuse JavaScript code to show/hide default password warnings in new page *Change Password*
        -   Helped in web services providing common method to return 404 HTTP status code if InstanceNotFound happens
        -   Implemented BaseCRUDController and adapted some controllers to it: labels, machines, exception days
        -   Defined IHumanIdentifiable interface
        -   Fixed critical bug \#1108 with Óscar's help. This bug is about a wrong mapping between Orders and Labels causing concurrency problems.

        -   Release [LibrePlan](/twiki/LibrePlan/LibrePlan) 1.1.2

    -   ![done.gif](/twiki/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/done.gif)
        -   Carry on testing [Sahi](http://sahi.co.in/w/) for functional testing with good results
        -   Replying users questions in mailing list
    -   ![todo.gif](/twiki/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/todo.gif)
        -   Ayalize more features for 1.2 release
        -   Starting to prepare contents for new website

-   Javichan introduced two points to discuss about
    -   Labels filtering issue:
        -   Rego thinks that we should fix it for next major release
    -   Duplicated names of tasks in Gantt and WBS
        -   Rego thinks that we should have just one name for tasks in Gantt and WBS
        -   Debate about the problem to save TaskElement and OrderElement from Gantt if we want to keep name just in OrderElement
        -   Óscar will take a look to the issue as part of his task of share state between perspective. Maybe saving everything is not a problem after his task
        -   Discussion will be moved to mailing list if needed

-   Nacho
    -   ![done.gif](/twiki/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/done.gif)
        -   LDAP Integration: Finished and already merged in master. We have now a quite flexible approach for role matching that seems to work in different LDAP configurations.
        -   Web Services: Implemented the method getEntity for all integration entities. You can get just one entity passing the code as an extra GET parameter
        -   Locale settings for user: Patch ready and pending revision
    -   ![todo.gif](/twiki/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/todo.gif)
