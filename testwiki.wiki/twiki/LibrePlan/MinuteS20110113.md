 Minutes
--------

-   Review and explanation of proposed tasks for version 1.1.
-   Debate about which features to include in version 1.1.
    -   Added some tasks for 1.1:
        -   Help improvement as we agreed is important for a complex application like LibrePlan.
        -   Allow configuration for default login auto-completion (`admin/admin`).
        -   Improve task identification for some reports (adding task name and project name).
        -   Support of intraday operations. Changing the grain of the work to allocate in order to introduce quantities that are not multiple of hours.
    -   Delayed some tasks to 1.2:
        -   [Critical chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Chain_Project_Management).
        -   Improve performance of resource load view.
    -   Prioritize the tasks for 1.1:
        -   Most important:
            -   Printing support improvement.
            -   Help improvement.
            -   Chromium browser complete support.
        -   Important:
            -   Limiting resources. New appropriative insertion algorithm.
            -   Resource levelling.
            -   Over allocation control.
            -   Heuristics in general allocations.
            -   Allocation functions (steps, S-curve) in simple allocation pop-up and some usability improvements.
        -   Minor:
            -   Violation of dependencies showed in Gantt.
            -   Default login auto-completion configuration.
            -   Tasks identification improvements in some reports.
        -   Delayable:
            -   Support of intraday operations. Possibility to establish not integer number of hours in allocations, task work (hours, minutes, seconds).
            -   Advance allocation fix.
-   Rough estimation for version 1.2.
    -   Added some tasks for 1.2:
        -   Add export/import for different format files.
        -   Possibility to attach documentation to projects and tasks.
    -   Delayed some tasks to future:
        -   Monte Carlo simulation improvements.
